Welcome to the Node Gym Project! This is a Node.js application built with TypeScript. It leverages the Fastify framework for building the server and Prisma for database interactions. This README will guide you through setting up, running, and testing the project.

## Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```
cd node-gym
```

Then, install the dependencies:
```
npm i
```
Now you need to run:
```
docker compose up
```
And now you can run some script.

## Scripts
This project uses several npm scripts for different tasks:

- **dev**: Starts the development server with hot reloading.
- **build**: Compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript and outputs it into the build directory.
- **start**: Runs the compiled server from the build directory.
- **test**: Runs all unit tests in the src/use-cases directory.
- **test:watch**: Runs unit tests in watch mode.
- **test:coverage**: Generates test coverage reports.
- **test:e2e**: Runs end-to-end tests in the src/http directory.
